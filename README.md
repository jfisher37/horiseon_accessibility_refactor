# Horiseon Accessibility Refactor

## Description
This is a refactoring of the Horiseon website. The site was refactored with the express purpose of making it more accessible and, consequently, more successful with regards to SEO (search engine optimization). A great deal of the changes made to website had to do with simplifying its code. For example there were a number of classes in its CSS that accomplished the same exact thing and could be condensed into a single class (and they were thusly condensed in the refactoring). Additionally, a number of div elements in the HTML were replaced with semantic HTML elements. Further, all images and icons were given alt attributes in the refactoring, which they did not have in the original version. Finally, there were several portions of code that were not written in logical order (ie: a number of CSS rules were listed not in the same order in which their respective HTML elements were written). Such portions of code were rearranged accordingly.
